# Cycle Dashboard
Live dashboard showing aggregated responses to a Google Form. This will be used at a charity event where attendees can ride a stationary bike for as long as they like. For each kilometer ridden, $10 will be donated to a charity. 

We will show a live dashboard displaying the top 5 riders for the three day event, the ten most recent rides, and the aggregate distance ridden and amount of money raised. 

The dashboard is built on a Django server, with the backend in Google Sheets which is fed data by Google Forms.
